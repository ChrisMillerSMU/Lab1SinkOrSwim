This repository contains our app experimenting with UIKit features in practice through the exploration of breweries nearby SMU. While the API is outdated, it allows for the user to explore breweries nearby SMU and get useful information about them that the API stores, such as the address and phone number of each brewery. Our app works when a phone is turned both vertically and horizontally.

Please refer to `Lab1demo__.mov` for a video and short demonstration of the app's functionality.
